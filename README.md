# Hotel-Management-System
## This is my project of Bank Management System in C++ only for TurboC and TurboC++
###### ***P.S: This Project will run only on TurboC and TurboC++ because of some <dos.h> header file fuctions included in the code which are not supported by the new compilers.***

Steps for running the program:

Step 1: Download the code from the GitHub Repository.

Step 2: After you unzip the file, create a folder named Banking at the location C:\TURBOC3\BIN.

Step 3: Paste all the 12 files which you have extracted by unziping the file (Bank-Management-System master) into the newly created Banking folder.

Step 4: Now, run the Screen1.cpp file in your TurboC or TurboC++ software.
