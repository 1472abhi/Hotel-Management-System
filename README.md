# Hotel-Management-System
## This is my project of Hotel Management System in C++ only for TurboC and TurboC++
###### *** This Project will run only on TurboC and TurboC++ because of some <dos.h> header file fuctions included in the code which are not supported by the new compilers.***

Steps for running the program:

Step 1: Download the code from the GitHub Repository.

Step 2: After you unzip the file, create a folder named Hotel at the location C:\TURBOC3\BIN.

Step 3: Paste all the files which you have extracted by unziping the file (hotel-Management-System master) into the newly created Hotel folder.

Step 4: Now, run the Hotel.cpp file in your TurboC or TurboC++ software.
